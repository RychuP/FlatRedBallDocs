# Skeleton

### Introduction

The Skeleton property gives you full access to the underlying Spine object. Simple games can work directly with the SpineDrawableBatch, but more complex games may require directly reading from or manipulating the Skeleton object.

For information about working directly with the Skeleton object, see the [Runtime Skeleton documentation on Spine's website](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtime-skeletons).
