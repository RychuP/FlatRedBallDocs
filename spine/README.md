You must own a license to Spine to use this in your project. For more information see the Spine runtimes license here: [https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/blob/4.1/spine-monogame/README.md](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/blob/4.1/spine-monogame/README.md)

### Integration Details

The Spine integration relies on Spine's official MonoGame integration. Most projects do not need to use this integration, but if you are interested in maintaining the Spine integration or peeking into how it works under the hood, you may want to start at the Spine Runtimes github:
