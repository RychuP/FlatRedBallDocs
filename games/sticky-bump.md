## Introduction

Sticky Bump is the reason to finally meet up with your friends again and have a blasting time playing a game. Once again a game will make you scream, laugh, feel proud, suspicious about secret conspiracies, and, inevitably, have people pushed off the couch. Sticky Bump is controlled with a single stick, it has competition and luck balanced just right, and with rules that are new for everyone, there's no excuse to not join in right away. ![Stickybump screen1.png](/media/migrated_media-Stickybump_screen1.png) ![Stickybump screen2.png](/media/migrated_media-Stickybump_screen2.png) ![Stickybump screen3.png](/media/migrated_media-Stickybump_screen3.png) ![Stickybump screen4.png](/media/migrated_media-Stickybump_screen4.png) ![Stickybump screen5.png](/media/migrated_media-Stickybump_screen5.png) ![Stickybump screen6.png](/media/migrated_media-Stickybump_screen6.png)
