### Introduction

Sticky Bump is the reason to finally meet up with your friends again and have a blasting time playing a game. Once again a game will make you scream, laugh, feel proud, suspicious about secret conspiracies, and, inevitably, have people pushed off the couch. Sticky Bump is controlled with a single stick, it has competition and luck balanced just right, and with rules that are new for everyone, there's no excuse to not join in right away. ![Stickybump screen1.png](../.gitbook/assets/migrated\_media-Stickybump\_screen1.png) ![Stickybump screen2.png](../.gitbook/assets/migrated\_media-Stickybump\_screen2.png) ![Stickybump screen3.png](../.gitbook/assets/migrated\_media-Stickybump\_screen3.png) ![Stickybump screen4.png](../.gitbook/assets/migrated\_media-Stickybump\_screen4.png) ![Stickybump screen5.png](../.gitbook/assets/migrated\_media-Stickybump\_screen5.png) ![Stickybump screen6.png](../.gitbook/assets/migrated\_media-Stickybump\_screen6.png)
