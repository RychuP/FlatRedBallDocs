## Introduction

Bobble Biker, from the makers of Juice Factory, is a casual racing game for all ages. How fast can you get your bobble-headed biker through the bumps, jumps and hazards of the obstacle courses? Touch the screen to go, and tilt the phone to lean. But be careful - knock your bikerâ€™s head off and you have to start over! Earn cash with each finish to unlock powerful bike upgrades and cool new bikers. Be awesome and youâ€™ll get on the leaderboards so you can brag to your friends!

Create your own courses with the in-game editor. The best user submissions will be included in future races. New courses are downloaded on-the-fly, so new content is arriving all the time! ![BobbleBiker1.png](/media/migrated_media-BobbleBiker1.png) ![BobbleBiker2.png](/media/migrated_media-BobbleBiker2.png) ![BobbleBiker3.png](/media/migrated_media-BobbleBiker3.png) ![BobbleBiker4.png](/media/migrated_media-BobbleBiker4.png)
