### Introduction

Set in the year SE 3256, the player is thrust into mankind's first interplanetary war between the Earth Alliance and the Ares Confederation. As the promising captain of the experimental dreadnought prototype, codenamed Sierra. Your sole objective is to help turn the tides of the war, utilizing the ship's advanced combat systems, flexible energy allocation and optimized platform deployment capabilities. To the captain, the core principles of prudence, guile, resource management and patience are essential to survival. The technology incorporated in Sierra allows it to explore multiple paths to victory: evade and assault enemy ships in classic broadside warfare; research armaments and upgrades to outgun the enemy fleet; or outnumber them with remotely-controlled weapon platforms. Rout the enemyâ€™s armada in order to quell the rebellion and save Earth from the corrupt colonials.
