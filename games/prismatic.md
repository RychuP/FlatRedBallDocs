### Introduction

Prismatic is an addicting puzzle game featuring a fully-illustrated story with 100 levels, 7 bonus modes, and magical powers. Prismatic is very original, and does not fall into an established genre. The object of the game is to direct beams of light around Aurora's castle to destroy orbs of darkness scattered throughout. This is done by placing mirrors in precise locations on each level. The player wins when they've destroyed all the orbs and lit up the entire castle.
