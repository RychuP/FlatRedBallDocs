## Introduction

Dodge and fire your way through waves of spacey rocks in this smooth-controlled action game. As the rocks quickly surround you, move down with them, plan a route back up, and go for it! If there's no chance; use your timed laser to create openings and make sure you use them while they're still there. Including HyperTime Checkpoints, and online and local leaderboards. ![HyperDodgeWP7HD1.png](/media/migrated_media-HyperDodgeWP7HD1.png) ![HyperDodgeWP7HD2.png](/media/migrated_media-HyperDodgeWP7HD2.png) ![HyperDodgeWP7HUD3.png](/media/migrated_media-HyperDodgeWP7HUD3.png)
