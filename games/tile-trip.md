### Introduction

Tile Trip is game of connections: Both players begin building from the center tile. One player tries to connect his gophers on the bottom to the delicious carrots on top. The second player tries to connect his gophers on the left to the tasty flowers on the right. On each player's turn they pick one of three possible tiles and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board. Each tile is 3x1 (played on a 15x15 board) and has three outlets. Your score is the number on one side \*multiplied by\* the number on the other side. You must play in both directions. If you do not connect to a side, your score is zero - remember anything times zero equals zero! The game requires users to play both offense and defense.
