### Introduction

Cargo Crush (from the makers of Juice Factory) offers you the chance to be a Baggage Handler on the hottest space cruiser in the solar system, the Stardust. Your mission is to stack passenger luggage quickly and efficiently. Sparing no expense, we've prepared two powerful Tractor Beams to move the cargo with (via multitouch). Don't worry, you'll receive plenty of on the job training!

As your skills improve, you'll unlock 5 distinct game modes across 3 difficulty levels, mastering a wide range of luggage wrangling moves in the process. Every level has a leaderboard, so when you do great work your name will be known from Mercury to Neptune!

Use the in-game editor to build your own levels and share them with other players in the test area. The most-loved levels will be incorporated into the main game. Levels are downloaded on-the-fly, so new content is arriving all the time! ![CargoCrushsc1.png](../.gitbook/assets/migrated\_media-CargoCrushsc1.png) ![CargoCrushsc2.png](../.gitbook/assets/migrated\_media-CargoCrushsc2.png) ![CargoCrushsc5.png](../.gitbook/assets/migrated\_media-CargoCrushsc5.png) ![CargoCrushsc8.png](../.gitbook/assets/migrated\_media-CargoCrushsc8.png)
