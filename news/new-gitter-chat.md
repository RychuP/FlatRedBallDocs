![gitter-announce](/media/2016-01-gitter-announce.png) For a long time FlatRedBall has had an awesome, active community of game developers and programmers in our live chat system. However, keeping the chat integrated and working through site updates as well as keeping it spam free was a challenge. We're trying something new. We invite you to try our new "[Gitter](https://gitter.im/)" chat system, available on the bottom left from any page. Gitter uses your GitHub account (you have one, right? Right?) to authenticate, which takes the burden off of us to keep your account safe and the chat spam free. Honestly, GitHub is better at it! Please join us and help foster a community that encourages new game developers and fun, interesting or just plain weird conversations between you seasoned pros. Chat soon!
