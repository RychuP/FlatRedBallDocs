# gum-components-in-entities

The latest version of Glue improves the integration between Gum and FlatRedBall. Gum objects in Glue now show all of their variables, and they can be modified just like native Glue objects. [![](../media/2018-04-img\_5ac383b28305d.png)](../media/2018-04-img\_5ac383b28305d.png) Objects added to Glue entities will automatically attach and move with the Glue object.
