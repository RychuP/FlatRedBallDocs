![bacon poem](../media/2016-04-5137923-300x300.jpg) After much anticipation, the often discussed event affectionately titled FRBacon (FlatRedBall Convention -> FRBCon -> FRBacon) took place over a gorgeous extended weekend in April in the hills overlooking Lehi, Utah: ![Utah Panoramic](../media/2016-04-IMG\_2496.jpg) Festivities began on Thursday, March 31st when the first of the FlatRedBallers arrived: ![vicjustinadam](../media/2016-04-vicjustinadam.jpg) These handsome gentlemen above, from left to right, are: Adam, Victor, and Justin Most everyone was in attendance on Friday, and we wasted no time getting the fun started! ![Playing Forza 4](../media/2016-04-20160401\_234544-1024x576.jpg) From left to right (heads, not bodies): Jared, Adam, Domenic, Kao, Paul, and Victor &#x20;

On Saturday, we fired up the grill and we ate. We ate a lot. Then we ate some more. Alcohol was consumed. We forgot the bacon, though, so the next day we made up for it: ![Domenic loves mustard](../media/2016-04-IMG\_0325-1024x768.jpg) This guy really likes mustard. Nice action shot!

Most of the rest of the weekend was spent playing copious amounts of games including Forza 4, Gears of War 3, Super Smash Bros, Torchlight II, and Borderlands 2.

![Forza 4](../media/2016-04-20160401\_234552-1024x576.jpg) When someone has 5 TVs and 4 XBox 360s, plus 4 copies of Forza 4, you just have to play 4 player Forza 4 for 4 hours straight. 4.

Ok we didn't play for 4 hours straight, but it felt good to say 4 a lot.

Suffice it to say we played a LOT of games for a very very long time, but that's just what you get when you get a bunch of gamers together. That's what FlatRedBall is all about, and that's what makes us tick. We work hard the whole year, and we deserve a little time to enjoy what makes us happy: good friends, good food, good fun... good times!

It's just too bad it had to end! ![WHAT???](../media/2016-04-IMG\_0323-150x150.jpg)WHAT YOU SAY?

Yea it's over... all good things must come to an end, but maybe next year is the year that you'll join us?
