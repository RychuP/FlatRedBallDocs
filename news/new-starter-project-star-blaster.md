As part of continuous improvement efforts, we are excited to announce a new starter project: Star Blaster. You can get started right away by updating FRBDK through the Glue update menu. Clicking file, new project, and then you will notice a difference in the new project creator: ![newprojectcreator_starters](/media/2016-05-new_project_creator.png) Select Star Blaster, a path, and then click "Make my project!" The project will download, and you should be able to justÂ [press play](/news/just-press-play/.md). Once running, you can use WASD to move your ship and spacebar to shoot. Since this is a Glue project download, you have full access to the project, including source code and content. ![starblaster](/media/2016-05-starblaster.gif) Feel free to use this starter project to get up and running quicker!
