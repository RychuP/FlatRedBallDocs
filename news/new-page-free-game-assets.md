# new-page-free-game-assets

I wanted to give a quick update in order to showcase a new page added silently (in the shadows!) to the content section: [game assets](broken-reference) On that page, we will be attempting to keep a curated list of our favorite free and cheap (i.e. worth it) visual art and sound assets for use in your games. Now you have no excuses!

* Free open source game engine? CHECK!
* Vibrant community? CHECK!
* Free art? CHECK!

You're going to have to write the code, but you really can't blame the lack of art any more, or we're going to roll our eyes pretty hard now.
