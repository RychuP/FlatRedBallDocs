# ðŸ–¥ Downloading FlatRedBall

### Prerequisites

#### 1 - Visual Studio 2022 or Newer

[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) Although it is possible to make games without Visual Studio or Rider, doing so requires advanced knowledge of MSBuild. We recommend downloading and installing Visual Studio Community which is free.

At a minimum you will need to install **.NET desktop development**.

#### 2. XNA 4.0 Redistributable

[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27598](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27598) Although this is not required to build and run FlatRedBall games, it is required to use Gum, which is the preferred FlatRedBall UI tool.

#### 3. .NET 6 SDK

[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

Visual Studio 2022 (as of version 17.5.1) installs .NET SDK 7.0 which has a bug preventing projects from being loaded in the FlatRedBall Editor. Therefore, you will need to manually install .NET 6 SDK.

### Downloading FlatRedBall

The most common approach to making FlatRedBall games is to use the FlatRedBall Editor. The Editor can be downloaded from a pre-built .zip file, or it can be built from source. New users should expand **Downloading Pre-Built FlatRedBall**. \[frb\_toggle title="Downloading Pre-Built FlatRedBall"]
