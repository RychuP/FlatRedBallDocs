The following set of tutorials will explore the impact of render breaks (also sometimes called render state changes) on the performance of a game. Understanding render breaks is important for squeezing maximum graphical performance for out of your game, especially on mobile platforms.

For information on the FlatRedBall Profiler, which can help measure render breaks, see the [FlatRedBall Profiler page](/frb/docs/index.php?title=Tutorials:FlatRedBallProfiler "Tutorials:FlatRedBallProfiler").
