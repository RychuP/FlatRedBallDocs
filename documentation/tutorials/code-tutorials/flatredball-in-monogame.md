## Introduction

FlatRedBall is a game engine which uses MonoGame for rendering, input, sound, and game structure. Typically FlatRedBall projects are created through Glue, but existing MonoGame projects can add FlatRedBall for additional functionality. The documents in this section provide more information on adding FlatRedBall to an existing MonoGame project. \[subpages depth="1"\]
