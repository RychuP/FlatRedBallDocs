## Introduction

XNA apps can run in either "Reach" or "HiDef" mode. Originally the Reach profile was created for Windows Phone 7 and PCs with pre-DirectX 10 cards. At the time of this writing virtually all PCs have hardware which can run HiDef, so creating PC games in HiDef will not restrict PC game audiences.

FlatRedBall PC templates still default to the Reach profile to be compatible with FlatRedBall iOS, Android, and Windows RT.
