## Introduction

Rock Blaster is a top-down Asteroids-like game. The following tutorials introduce a variety of advanced topics. These tutorials continue to advance the concepts and FlatRedBall functionality introduced by Beefball. **Note:** RockBlaster contains useful information about how to use the FlatRedBall Editor (also referred to as Glue in these tutorials), but it is a tutorial which was written before many of the current FlatRedBall features were created. Therefore, some of the approaches in this tutorial may not represent the current recommended patterns.
