# 01-new-project-setup

This tutorial begins with a new platformer project. To create a new platformer project, see this tutorial: https://flatredball.com/documentation/tutorials/platformer-plugin/ground-type-and-water-movement/01-new-project-setup/ Once finished, your project will have a character which is animated and ready to go. The remainder of the tutorials in this series cover how to modify the animations on the player and how to add new animations in response to game logic. &#x20;
