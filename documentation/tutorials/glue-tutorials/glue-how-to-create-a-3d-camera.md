# glue-how-to-create-a-3d-camera

### Introduction

FlatRedBall supports 3D cameras. Default Glue projects are 2D but can easily be converted to 3D.

### Changing the Camera in Glue

If your entire project is a 3D game, you can set the Camera to 3D in the Camera Settings window. For more information see [this page](../../../frb/docs/index.php).
