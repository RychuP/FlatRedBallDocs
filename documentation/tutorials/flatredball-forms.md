## Introduction

FlatRedBall.Forms is a library which provides a full set of UI functionality similar to other UI libraries like Windows Forms, Xamarin.Forms, and WPF. FlatRedBall.Forms is intended to mimic the syntax of WPF while allowing you to customize the visuals and layout of your UI using the Gum UI tool. Properly using FlatRedBall.Forms requires at least a basic understanding of working with Gum. Developers who are not familiar with Gum should first visit the Gum tutorials, which can be found here: [/documentation/tools/gum/gum-tutorials.md](/documentation/tools/gum/gum-tutorials.md) To get started, you will want to start with the Getting Started Tutorials: [/documentation/tutorials/flatredball-forms/getting-started.md](/documentation/tutorials/flatredball-forms/getting-started.md)
