## Layer

Layers are containers which can be used to control the draw order of objects. Layers provide an alternative to setting the Z value of graphical objects for rendering. Typically layers are created for categories of objects such as:

-   Game HUD
-   Pause Menu
-   Popups
-   Command UI (UI which may be used in an RTS to give commands to units)
