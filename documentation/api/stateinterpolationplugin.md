## Introduction

The StateInterpolationPlugin namespace is part of the StateInterpolation library. Initially the code contained in this library was embedded in FlatRedBall projects by the Advanced State Interpolation plugin. More recently, the StateInterpolation.dll library is automatically added to new FlatRedBall projects. Therefore, newer FlatRedBall projects will already have access to the StateInterpolationPlugin namespace.
