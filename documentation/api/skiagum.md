## Introduction

SkiaGum provides the ability to render Skia objects using the Gum rendering and layout system. SkiaGum objects can be rendered as standalone objects, or they can be embedded in Gum (GraphicalUiElement) objects to take advantage of Gum's powerful layout engine. SkiaGum provides a number of common primitives such as RoundedRectangle and ColoredCircle, but custom Skia rendering is also fully supported. For an introduction to SkiaGum, see the [announcement blog post here](/news/gum-now-supports-skiasharp.md).
