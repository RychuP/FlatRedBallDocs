## Introduction

The RenderState contains a variety of settings which can change now rendering is performed. FlatRedBall automatically sets RenderState values appropriately when drawing different types of objects, but users may need to modify RenderStates when using [DrawableBatches](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.DrawableBatch "FlatRedBall.Graphics.DrawableBatch").
