# Introduction

Vector3 is used throughout FlatRedBall to store position, velocity, and acceleration values. Also, the Vector3 struct is used in many places to perform common math operations such as to determine the distance or angle between two objects. Vector3 is located in the Microsoft.Xna.Framework namespace and is a native part of MonoGame. FlatRedBall offers additional extension methods to the Vector3 type through the Vector3ExtensionMethods class. To use this, add the following using statement to your code:

```
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
```
