## Introduction

The IErrorReporter interface is used to report errors to the user.  Implementations of this interface can be registered to Glue through a Plugin's AddErrorReporter method. An IErrorReporter is responsible for returning an array of ErrorViewModels. Typically a plugin will create an IErrorReporter for errors that pertain to the particular plugin. For example, the Gum plugin has an ErrorReporter which reports errors specific to Gum files. The only responsibility for an IErrorReporter is to return an array of ErrorViewModels. Each ErrorViewModel manages itself once it is created. Specifically, ErrorViewModels can respond to events such as a file changed, and can return whether they are fixed. Therefore, it is common for the same logic to be used in creating ErrorViewModel instances as well as checking if an existing ErrorViewModel is fixed.
