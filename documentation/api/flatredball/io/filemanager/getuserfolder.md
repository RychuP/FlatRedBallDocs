## Introduction

The GetUserFolder method returns a string which can be used to save and load files in the user folder. To use this, the [InitializeUserFolder](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.IO.FileManager.InitializeUserFolder.md "FlatRedBall.IO.FileManager.InitializeUserFolder") method must be called first. The return value for GetUserFolder depends on the platform that the call is made on; however, it can be used on any platform with most methods that access the file system through the FileManager.

## Code Example

For an example on how to use GetUserFolder, see the [InitializeUserFolder](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.IO.FileManager.InitializeUserFolder.md "FlatRedBall.IO.FileManager.InitializeUserFolder") article.
