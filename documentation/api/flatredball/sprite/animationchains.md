## Introduction

The AnimationChains property defines the AnimationChains used by the Sprite. This can be assigned in code or in the FlatRedBall Editor. For more information on working with AnimationChains in code, see the [IAnimationChainAnimatable AnimationChains page](/documentation/api/flatredball/flatredball-graphics/animation/flatredball-graphics-animation-ianimationchainanimatable/flatredball-graphics-animation-ianimationchainanimatable-animationchains/.md).
