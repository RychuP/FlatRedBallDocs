*OBSOLETE* The PixelSize property is an obsolete property which was commonly used prior to summer 2013. The [TextureScale](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Sprite.TextureScale "FlatRedBall.Sprite.TextureScale") property has replaced the PixelSize property. The PixelSize property is equivalent to TexutureScale/2. The PixelSize property was originally created to work well with ScaleX and ScaleY values, but since then [FlatRedBall.Sprite.TextureScale](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Sprite.TextureScale "FlatRedBall.Sprite.TextureScale"), Width, and Height have replaced PixelSize, ScaleX, and ScaleY as the most common ways to interact with a Sprite.
