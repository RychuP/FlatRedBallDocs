## Introduction

The JustCycled returns true when the Sprite has just finished its animation and hasÂ *cycled* (returned from the last frame to the first). This can be used to perform logic when a Sprite has looped its animation. For more information, see the [IAnimationChainAnimatable.JustCycled page](/documentation/api/flatredball/flatredball-graphics/animation/flatredball-graphics-animation-ianimationchainanimatable/flatredball-graphics-animation-ianimationchainanimatable-justcycled/.md).
