## Introduction

The RelativeRotationZ property controls the rotation of a PositionedObject relative to its parent. If an object does not have a parent (is not attached), RelativeRotationZ will not impact the final rotation of an object. If an object is attached, then RotationZ becomes read-only, and RelativeRotationZ controls the rotation of the object relative to its parent. Â
