## Introduction

The OrderedSprites list contains all of the Sprites that will be rendered by the SpriteManager. It does not include any Sprites which are on [Layers](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.Layer "FlatRedBall.Graphics.Layer"), nor any Sprites which are z-buffered. This list can be used at runtime to verify whether Sprites that you expect to be created actually are created, or to investigate their properties in the watch window.
