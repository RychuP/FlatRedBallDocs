## Introduction

The ManagedPositionedObject list in the SpriteManager object is a list of [PositionedObjects](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.PositionedObject.md "FlatRedBall.PositionedObject") which the SpriteManager is managing. In a typical project (using Glue), this list will contain mostly instances of Entities in your game, so you can look at this list to see what is actively managed.
