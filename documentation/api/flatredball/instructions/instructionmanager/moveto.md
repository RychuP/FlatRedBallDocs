## Introduction

The MoveTo function is a function which will take the argument PositionedObject and will set its Velocity so that it moves to the argument location in a set amount of time, as specified by the secondsToTake parameter. The MoveTo function will do two things:

1.  It will modify the velocity values of the PositionedObject.
2.  It will add instructions to the PositionedObject's Instructions list.
