## Introduction

The GamePadsForUiControl list specifies which game pads can be used to control FlatRedBall.Forms controls. By default this list is empty, but it can be populated with gamepads to enable navigation and selection of UI with the DPad, AnalogSticks, and Buttons. For more information see the [Forms and Xbox360Gamepad](/documentation/tutorials/flatredball-forms/forms-and-xbox360gamepad/.md) page.
