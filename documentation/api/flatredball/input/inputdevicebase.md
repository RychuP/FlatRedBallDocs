# Introduction

InputDeviceBase is a base class for implementing a custom InputDevice. The InputDeviceBase provides default implementation for all IInputDevice properties, allowing derived classes to override only some of the available properties. The InputDeviceBase class can also be instantiated to create an IInputDevice-implementing instance which returns 0 and false for all properties.   &#x20;
