## Introduction

The Deadzone property can be used to addressÂ *drift* which can occur due to analog stick hardware reporting near-zero values, or due to the user unintentionally pushing the analog slightly in an undesired direction. By default, Xbox360GamePads use a 0.1f Deadzone value. The details of how the Deadzone property is applied can be found in the DeadzoneType page.
