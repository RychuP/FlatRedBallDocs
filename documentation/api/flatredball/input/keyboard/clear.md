## Introduction

The Clear method clears out input from the Keyboard. After Clear is called, all Keyboard methods and properties will behave as if there was no keyboard activity this frame. This function is useful when implementing functionality that should consume input, and is commonly used with the [IInputReceiver](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Gui.IInputReceiver "FlatRedBall.Gui.IInputReceiver") interface.
