## Introduction

The Layers property contains all of the [Layers](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.Layer.md "FlatRedBall.Graphics.Layer") specific to this Camera. Cameras will have one Layer in the Layers property by default. This can be accessed in one of two ways:

    var defaultLayer = CameraInstance.Layers[0];

or

    var defaultLayer = CameraInstance.Layer;

Notice that the first Layer in Layers is equivalent to the Layer property. For more information on the Layer property, [see this page](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Camera.Layer.md "FlatRedBall.Camera.Layer").
