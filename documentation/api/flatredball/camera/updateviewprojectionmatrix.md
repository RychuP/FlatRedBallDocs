## Introduction

The UpdateViewProjectionMatrix updates the [View](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Camera.View.md "FlatRedBall.Camera.View") and [Projection](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Camera.Projection&action=edit&redlink=1.md "FlatRedBall.Camera.Projection (page does not exist)") properties according to the Camera's current state. This function is automatically called on all Cameras which are a part of FlatRedBall every frame prior to the frame being rendered, but if the [View](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Camera.View.md "FlatRedBall.Camera.View") and [Projection](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Camera.Projection&action=edit&redlink=1.md "FlatRedBall.Camera.Projection (page does not exist)") properties are needed after the Camera has been updated, then UpdateViewProjectionMatrix needs to be called.
