The MakeOneWay method is a method which modifies all contained objects in the Scene so that they no longer are aware that they are part of the Scene. In other words, this breaks [two-way relationships](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Math.AttachableList#A_short_discussion_about_two-way_relationships.md "FlatRedBall.Math.AttachableList") between the Scene and its contained objects.
