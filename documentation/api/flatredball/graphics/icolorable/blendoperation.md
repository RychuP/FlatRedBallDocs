## Introduction

BlendOperation can control how an IColorable (such as a Sprite) will render on top of objects under it. The default ColorOperation for most renderable objects is [BlendOperation.Regular](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.BlendOperation.md "FlatRedBall.Graphics.BlendOperation"). For examples on how BlendOperation is applied, see the BlendOperation page here: [/documentation/api/flatredball/flatredball-graphics/flatredball-graphics-blendoperation.md](/documentation/api/flatredball/flatredball-graphics/flatredball-graphics-blendoperation.md)
