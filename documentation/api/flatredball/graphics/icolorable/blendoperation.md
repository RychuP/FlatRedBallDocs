# Introduction

BlendOperation can control how an IColorable (such as a Sprite) will render on top of objects under it. The default ColorOperation for most renderable objects is [BlendOperation.Regular](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php). For examples on how BlendOperation is applied, see the BlendOperation page here: [https://flatredball.com/documentation/api/flatredball/flatredball-graphics/flatredball-graphics-blendoperation/](../blendoperation.md)
