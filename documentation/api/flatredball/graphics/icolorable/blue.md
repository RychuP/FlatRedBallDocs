# Introduction

The Red, Green, and Blue values in an IColorable represent the three color components used when applying the [ColorOperation](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php). Since the [ColorOperation](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) impacts how color is applied, then the color represented by Red, Green, and Blue may not necessarily describe the color of the object on-screen.
