## Introdctuion

Multi-sampling (also known as anti-aliasing) can improve the visual appearance of your game, but can come at a performance cost. By default FlatRedBall has this value set to false.

## Code Example

To turn on multi-sampling, simply set the UseMultiSampling to true:

    FlatRedBallServices.GraphicsOptions.UseMultiSampling = true;
