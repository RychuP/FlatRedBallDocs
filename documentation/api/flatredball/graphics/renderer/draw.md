## Introduction

The Draw function is responsible for looping through all Cameras in FlatRedBall and performing rendering for each one. This method is automatically called for you in a default template, so most games do not require manually calling this method. The Renderer's Draw method is usually called by the [FlatRedBallServices object](/documentation/api/flatredball/flatredball-flatredballservices.md "FlatRedBall.FlatRedBallServices"). You can modify the game code where [FlatRedBallServices.Draw](/documentation/api/flatredball/flatredball-flatredballservices.mdflatredball-flatredballservices-draw/ "FlatRedBall.FlatRedBallServices.Draw") is called to customize how rendering occurs (such as to do custom render targets). For more information, see [this page](/documentation/api/flatredball/flatredball-flatredballservices.mdflatredball-flatredballservices-draw/ "FlatRedBall.FlatRedBallServices.Draw")
