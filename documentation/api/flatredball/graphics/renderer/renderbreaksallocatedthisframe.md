# Introduction

The RenderBreaksAllocatedThisFrame property returns how many render breaks have been created and applied during the last rendering pass. Render breaks can significantly slow down the performance of your game, and reducing the number of render breaks occurring in each render pass can provide big performance boosts without requiring you to reduce the number of objects in your game.

For a detailed discussion of render breaks, see [this page](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php).
