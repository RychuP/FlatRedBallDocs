## Introduction

The RenderBreak struct is a struct used internally by the engine to identify when to switch rendering states during a vertex buffer rendering pass. Vertex buffers are used to render most FRB types including [Sprites](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Sprite.md "FlatRedBall.Sprite"), [Texts](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.Text.md "FlatRedBall.Graphics.Text"), and [Shapes](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Math.Geometry.ShapeManager.md "FlatRedBall.Math.Geometry.ShapeManager"). You will likely not need to interact with RenderBreak if you are writing game-level code. This class is only used in rendering code.
