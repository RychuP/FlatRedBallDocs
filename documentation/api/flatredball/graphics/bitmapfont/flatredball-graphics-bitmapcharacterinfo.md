## Introduction

The BitmapCharacterInfo contains information about a single character in a [FlatRedBall.Graphics.BitmapFont](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.BitmapFont.md "FlatRedBall.Graphics.BitmapFont"). Usually BitmapCharacterInfos are not manually created - they are created automatically when loading a .fnt file into a BitmapFont; however, if you are creating custom fonts in code, you can do so by creating BitmapCharacterInfos.
