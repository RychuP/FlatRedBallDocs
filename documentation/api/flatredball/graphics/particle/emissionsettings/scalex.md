## Introduction

The ScaleX and ScaleY properties control the size of Sprites when they are emitted.

## Code Example

The following code sets the ScaleX and ScaleY to 16 on the Emitter called "BulletEmitter":

    BulletEmitter.EmissionSettings.ScaleX = 16;
    BulletEmitter.EmissionSettings.ScaleY = 16;
