## Introduction

EmissionSettings stores information about how individual Sprite particles will behave after they are created by an Emitter. Each [Emitter](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.Particle.Emitter.md "FlatRedBall.Graphics.Particle.Emitter") contains an EmissionSettings instance which controls how particles emit.
