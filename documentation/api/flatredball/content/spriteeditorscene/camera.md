## Introduction

The SpriteEditorScene's Camera property is a [CameraSave](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Content.Scene.CameraSave "FlatRedBall.Content.Scene.CameraSave") which stores information about the [FlatRedBall.Camera](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Camera "FlatRedBall.Camera").

This property is by default not used when loading a .scnx file by the engine. It is primarily used to store the position of the [Camera](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Camera "FlatRedBall.Camera") in tools like the SpriteEditor and TileEditor. However, this member can be accessed to set a [Camera's](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Camera "FlatRedBall.Camera") properties to match what has been saved.

For information on how to use the SpriteEditorScene's Camera property, see the [CameraSave](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Content.Scene.CameraSave "FlatRedBall.Content.Scene.CameraSave") page.
