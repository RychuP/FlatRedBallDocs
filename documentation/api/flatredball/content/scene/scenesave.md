## Introduction

The SceneSave class is a class responsible for loading .scnx files and providing the information in a way that can be used to construct runtime objects. SceneSaves can also be used to save .scnx files easily.

## SceneSave vs. SpriteEditorScene

SceneSave is a class that is a replacement for SpriteEditorScene. It is functionally identical, but follows the "Save" naming convention present in the rest of the engine. During this transition you can look at the [SpriteEditorScene wiki page](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Content.SpriteEditorScene.md "FlatRedBall.Content.SpriteEditorScene") for information on how to work with SceneSave.
