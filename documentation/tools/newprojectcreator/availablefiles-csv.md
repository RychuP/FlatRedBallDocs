## Introduction

The AvailableFiles.csv file is a file which tells the NewProjectCreator which files are available for new projects. This file is automatically populated for all current FlatRedBall project types, but you can add your own project types here if you'd like to support custom projects.

## File Location

Assuming FlatRedBall is installed in the default location, you should be able to find the AvailableFiles.csv file in this location:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\FlatRedBall\FRBDK\Xna 4 Tools\Content\AvailableFiles.csv
