## Introduction

The Tools window provides access to common actions. This section discusses how to use the Tool Window in the PolygonEditor.

## Move Button

The Move Button is marked as an M. To use the Move button:

1.  Move the cursor over the M button and click the left mouse button.
2.  Move the mouse over any shape.
3.  Push and hold the mouse button down. Move the cursor and the shape will move along with the cursor.

The Move Button can also be used to move individual points in a Polygon. The process is the same as moving points - just click and drag the point with the Move Button pressed.

## Scale Button

The Scale Button is marked as an S. To use the Scale button:

1.  Move the cursor over the S button and click the left mouse button.
2.  Move the mouse over any shape.
3.  Push and hold the mouse button down. Move the cursor and the selected shape will grow or shrink.

Keep in mind that spheres and circles will uniformly scale in all directions, while other shapes such as rectangles and polygons can be scaled on each axis independently.

## Rotate Button

The Rotate Button is marked as an R. To use the Rotate Button:

1.  Move the cursor over the R button and click the left mouse button.
2.  Move the mouse over any rotatable shape. See below for more information.
3.  Push and hold the button down. Move the cursor and the selected shape will rotate.

Not all shapes can be rotated. Circles and Spheres cannot be rotated because rotation does not have any impact on the behavior or visibility of these two shapes. Rectangles and Cubes cannot be rotated because they are specifically created to remain axis-aligned for performance reasons.

## Add Point Button

The Add Point Button can be used to add additional points to your Polygons. The Add Point Button is only functional when a Polygon is selected since additional points cannot be added to any other shape.

To add a point to a Polygon:

1.  Create a new Polygon or select an existing Polygon
2.  Push the Add Point button. You will see a marker indicating the position of the absolute position of the new point.![NewPointMarker.png](/media/migrated_media-NewPointMarker.png)
3.  Click the mouse to place the new point. You will see a new point appear. You can continually add more points simply by moving the mouse and clicking.![MultiplePoints.png](/media/migrated_media-MultiplePoints.png)
4.  Push the Add Point Button to stop adding points.
