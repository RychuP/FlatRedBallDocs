## Introduction

The Tile Plugin combines multiple technologies to make tile rendering in FlatRedBall easy and efficient. This plugin can be used in a very high-level way which requires no programming at all, but can also be used in code to customize appearance and behavior. The library can be found [here](http://www.gluevault.com/plug/94-tiled-plugin).
