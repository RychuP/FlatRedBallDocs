## Introduction

The Implements IVisible property controls whether Glue automatically generates a Visible property for a given Entity. If this value is set to true, then Glue will create a Visible property which can be set to true/false in code. It also enables exposing/tunneling in to the Visible property on the Entity in Glue. ![ImplementsIVisibleGeneralExample.png](/media/migrated_media-ImplementsIVisibleGeneralExample.png)

## What is "IVisible"?

IVisible is a code interface defined in FlatRedBall. This interface primarily provides a Visible property. For information on working with IVisible in code, see the [IVisible page](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.IVisible.md "FlatRedBall.Graphics.IVisible").
