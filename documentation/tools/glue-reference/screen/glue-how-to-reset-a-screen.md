## Introduction

You may want to reset a screen under certain situations. For example when the player loses all of his or her lives then the screen may need to reset to its original state so the player can start the game over.

## Code

To reset a screen, see the [MoveToScreen page](/frb/docs/index.php?title=Glue:Reference:Screens:MoveToScreen#Resetting_a_Screen.md "Glue:Reference:Screens:MoveToScreen").
