# Introduction

IsManuallyUpdated controls whether the object created by loading a given file is manually updated. By default this value is false, indicating that objects are (by default) automatically updated by the engine. ![IsManuallyUpdatedGlue.png](../../../../media/migrated\_media-IsManuallyUpdatedGlue.png) Setting this value to true can improve the runtime performance of your game, especially if your file contains a large number of objects. The downside to setting this value to true is that Velocity, Acceleration, Drag, Attachment, and Animations will not apply on any contained objects. Furthermore, any changes to objects (such as changing the position of Sprites manually) may not be reflected in rendering. This property is only available on files in Screens. Entire entities can be converted to manually updated using the [ConvertToManuallyUpdated](../code/glue-reference-converttomanuallyupdated.md) method.   For more information on manual vs. automatic updates, see [this page](../../../../frb/docs/index.php).
