## Introduction

Most files in Glue are automatically loaded. When these files are loaded, the information which is loaded is stored in an object so that you and the FlatRedBall engine can access this information. The RuntimeType property sets which type of object the file will load into. In most cases the RuntimeType will be automatically set for you by Glue to the most common object type for a given file; however in some cases you may need to change this.
