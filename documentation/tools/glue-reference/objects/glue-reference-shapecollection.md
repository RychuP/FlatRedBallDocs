## Introduction

Glue supports creating objects of type ShapeCollection. You can create ShapeCollection objects two ways:

1.  From a .shcx file. To do this, first you must create a .schx file. For information on creating a ShapeCollection file, see [this page](/frb/docs/index.php?title=Glue:Reference:Files:ShapeCollection_(.shcx).md "Glue:Reference:Files:ShapeCollection (.shcx)"). Once you have a ShapeCollection file, you can create an object using the "Entire File" option. For information on this, see [this page](/frb/docs/index.php?title=Glue:Reference:Objects:Entire_File.md "Glue:Reference:Objects:Entire File").
2.  With no backing file. To do this:
    1.  Right-click on Objects under a Screen or Entity
    2.  Select "Add Object"
    3.  Verify that "FlatRedBall or Custom Type" is selected.
    4.  Select "ShapeCollection"
    5.  Click OK ![AddShapeCollectionObject.PNG](/media/migrated_media-AddShapeCollectionObject.PNG)

## Adding Shapes to a ShapeCollection in Glue

ShapeCollections which are defined in Glue can have shapes added manually. The ShapeCollection serves as a "list" of shapes, but unlike normal lists in Glue, the ShapeCollection can contain multiple types of objects: UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## ShapeCollection in code

For information on how to work with a ShapeCollection in code, see [the ShapeCollection page](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Math.Geometry.ShapeCollection.md "FlatRedBall.Math.Geometry.ShapeCollection").
