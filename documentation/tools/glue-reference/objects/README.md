## Introduction

Objects in Glue are how most visual objects are added to your game. Objects can be added to Screens and Entities, and when added through Glue, objects will automatically be managed. Objects can be grouped in one of three categories:

1.  Instances of entities
2.  Primitive types (such as FlatRedBall Sprite or Circle)
3.  Objects obtained from a file

## Creating an Entity Instance

Entity instances can be created in Glue by drag+dropping an entity onto the Objects folder of a Screen or another entity.
