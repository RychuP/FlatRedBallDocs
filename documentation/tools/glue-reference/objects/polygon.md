# polygon

### Introduction

Polygons can be added to screens and entities to create complex collision. Polygons will automatically be used in an entity's collisions if the entity is marked as ICollidable in Glue. For information on working with the Polygon object in code, see the [Polygon class reference](../../../api/flatredball/math/geometry/polygon.md).

### Adding a Polygon to an Entity

Polygons can be added to entities:

1. Select the entity which will have the Polygon
2. Select the Quick Actions tab
3.  Click the Add Object button

5.  Click OK

If the containing Entity is an ICollidable, the Polygon will automatically be used when performing collision.

### Editing Polygons

Polygons can be edited through the Points tab, which appears when selecting a Polygon.
