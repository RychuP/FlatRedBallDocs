## Introduction

The IncludeInIClickable property enables the exclusion of a shape from the IClickable interface checks. By default all shapes and Sprites added to an entity are checked in the HasCursorOver method. In other words, by default this property is set to true. This value can be set to false to exclude a shape from IClickable. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/819954682029277185/1090015108433973368/image.png)
