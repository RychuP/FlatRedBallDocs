### Common Text Usage

Since Text objects are usually used for game UI, the following properties are usually set in Glue:

* [LayerOn](layeron.md) - Text objects are usually placed on a UI or HUD layer
* [AttachToCamera](glue-reference-attachtocamera.md) - Text objects are usually displayed in a fixed position on screen
