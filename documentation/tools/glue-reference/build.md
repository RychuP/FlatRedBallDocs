## Introduction

The Build tab provides controls for building and running your Glue project from Glue. Common usage includes:

-   Adding entities and objects, then running the project to see the changes.
-   Changing content and clicking **Build Content** while the game is running, then reloading the screen to reload all content without restarting your project.

The **Build** tab can be found at the bottom of Glue.
