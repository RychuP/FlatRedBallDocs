Note: The ParticleEditor is no longer maintained and may not even function on newer computers (Windows 10). This tool has been replaced with a Glue pugin: <http://www.gluevault.com/plug/62-particle-editor-plugin-glue>   The Particle Editor is a [FlatRedBall](/frb.md) tool used to create Emitter files which are save in an XML format. The common extension for Emitter files is .emix. Emix files can also be loaded and saved in FlatRedBall game engines allowing two-way interaction between the ParticleEditor and the FlatRedBall game engine. Files created by the ParticleEditor are supported in all FlatRedBall Engines
