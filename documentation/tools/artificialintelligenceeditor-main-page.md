## Introduction

The AI Editor (Artificial Intelligence Editor) is an application which can be used to create XML files that define "node networks". These files can be loaded and used for pathfinding in the FlatRedBall Engine. Note that the AI Editor is an older FlatRedBall tool requiring XNA 3.1 runtime.

## Setup

To run the AI Editor:

1.  Download XNA 3.1 Redistributable from <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=15163>

2.  Run the XNA 3.1 Redistributable to install XNA 3.1

3.  Download the FRBDK.zip file from the Downloads page (you may already have done this and the next step if you have Glue)

4.  Unzip the **FRBDK.zip**

5.  Open the **FRBDK** folder created when unzipping FRBDK.zip

6.  Run ****AIEditor.exe****
