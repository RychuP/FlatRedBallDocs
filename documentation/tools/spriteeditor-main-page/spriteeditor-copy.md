## Introduction

The SpriteEditor supports copying objects in a Scene for quick duplication. To copy an object:

1.  Select an object
2.  Press the CTRL+C hotkey or press the Duplicate button in the Tools window.

A duplicate of the selected object will be created. You may need to move the original object to see the new copy.
