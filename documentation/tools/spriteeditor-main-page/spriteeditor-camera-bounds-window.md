## Introduction

The Camera Bounds Window is a Window can can be used to see the visible bounds of the Camera at a set of Camera properties.

If you have ever wondered about object placement or scale so that objects you place extend to the visible bounds in the game, then the Camera Bounds Window can help you solve this problem.

## Accessing the Camera Bounds Window

To access the Camera Bounds Window:

1.  Click the Window menu item.
2.  Select "Camera Bounds"
3.  Press the '-' key or zoom out by using the mouse scroll wheel.

You should see a white rectangle marking the visible bounds of your scene at Z = 0 and a Camera PropertyGrid labeled "Camera Bounds". This Camera PropertyGrid has all of the same controls as the regular Camera PropertyGrid which shows the Properties of the camera which the Scene is being viewed through.

Simply edit the properties to match the settings in your game. The default setting of Orthogonal as false and the Z of -40 matches the default properties in a regular FlatRedBall application.
