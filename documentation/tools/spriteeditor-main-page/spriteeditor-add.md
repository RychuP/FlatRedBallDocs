## Sprite

-   Allows users to add a Sprite to the workspace in the SpriteEditor.
-   Users have the option of navigating to any directory they choose to add a Sprite.

## SpriteGrid

-   Allows users to add a SpriteGrid to the workspace in the SpriteEditor
-   Essentially, by taking an image, users can create a full grid of Sprites and then apply a change across the board (such as rotation) by editing one Sprite and confirming the change. This can be very useful if users are trying to create a board or a map for a game. Additionally, users can determine how far apart the Sprites should be, as well as the dimension of the SpriteGrid.
-   For more information on SpriteGrids, see the SpriteGrid tutorial:

## SpriteFrame

-   Allows users to add a SpriteFrame to the workspace in the SpriteEditor.
-   For more information on SpriteFrames, see the SpriteFrame tutorial:
    -   [http://www.flatredball.com/frb/docs/index.php?title=SpriteFrame_Tutorial](/frb/docs/index.php?title=SpriteFrame_Tutorial)

## Model

-   Allows users to add a new 3D model to the workspace in the SpriteEditor
-   The SpriteEditor unfortunately only supports adding .X files for models â€“ this is a problem with MDX. However, FlatRedBall XNA handles both .X and .FBX models.

## Text

-   Allows users to add a new text box to SpriteEditor workspace.
-   The text can be edited, repositioned, scaled, and the color can be changed as well
-   For more information on Text, see Text tutorial entry:
    -   [http://www.flatredball.com/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.Text](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.Text)

## Texture

-   Allows users to add a new (premade) texture for a Sprite to the workspace.
-   In the SpriteEditor, every time a Sprite is created, it creates a texture as well. When changing textures, it is essentially like switching pictures out of a frame. The bounds of the sprite will stay the same, but the displayed texture will be different.
-   For more information about Texturing, see the Texture entry for Sprites:
    -   [http://www.flatredball.com/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Sprite#Texture](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Sprite#Texture)

## Animation Chain

-   Allows users to add a new (premade) AnimationChain to the workspace.
-   In the SpriteEditor, you can paint AnimationChains onto a Sprite. This is the easiest way to animate a Sprite.
-   For more information about AnimationChains, see the AnimationChain wiki entry:
    -   [http://www.flatredball.com/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.Animation.AnimationChain](/frb/docs/index.php?title=FlatRedBall.Graphics.Animation.AnimationChain)
