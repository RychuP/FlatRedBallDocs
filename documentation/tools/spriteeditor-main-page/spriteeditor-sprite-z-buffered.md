## Introduction

Z Buffered Sprites can intersect with each other and appear to overlap appropriately. Unlike the default sorting mode (ordered sorting), Z Buffered Sprites will sort on a per-pixel basis.

## Enabling Z Buffered Sorting

Under the Basic category Sprites can be set to be ordered by "Distance From Camera" or "ZBuffered"
