The SpriteEditor is one of the many tools available from the makers of the FlatRedBall Game Engine. For more information on FlatRedBall, check out the main site at [http://www.flatredball.com/frb/](/frb.md). The SpriteEditor is the tool primarily used to create Scenes and manipulate Sprites graphically. It can also do several other things, such as adding Text objects, applying textures to Sprites, and manipulating the Camera graphically.
