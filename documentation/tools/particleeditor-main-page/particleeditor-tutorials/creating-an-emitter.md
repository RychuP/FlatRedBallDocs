Before creating an emitter, we will need a Glue project with either a Screen or Entity. We'll add our emitter to an Entity to make it reusable.

To add a new emitter file:

1.  Right-click on an Enity's Files in Glue (.emix files can also be added to Screens or Global Content Files)
2.  Select "Add File"-\>"New File"
3.  Select "Emitter List (.emix)" as the file type
4.  Click OK

Selecting the newly-created file will display the Emitter plugin:

Newly-created .emix files are empty, so we will need to add an emitter. Note that .emix files can contain one or more emitters. To add an emitter:

1.  Right-click on the empty area on the left side of the plugin view
2.  Select "Add emitter..."
3.  Enter a name for the new Emitter
4.  Click OK
