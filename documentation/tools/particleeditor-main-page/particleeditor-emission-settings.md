## Color Values

The EmissionSettings provides color values and color rate values. For these values to be applied to Sprites, the "ColorOperation" must be changed from its default value of "SelectArg1". The default value of SelectArg1 means that the emitted particles will use the texture color and ignore color values. Common values include SelectArg2, Add, and Modulate.
