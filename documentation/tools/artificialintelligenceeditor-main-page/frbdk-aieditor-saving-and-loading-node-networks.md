## Introduction

Node networks are saved to .nntx files which can be loaded to instances of the NodeNetwork class. The .nntx file is a XML file (nnt coming from node network and x from XML) so it can be used in any application including non FRB applications. Of course, FRB provides convenient methods for working with node networks.

## Saving and Loading in the AIEditor

To save a .nntx file select:

    File->Save NodeNetwork

You have the option to save as either a XML or a NNTX file. NNTX is the standard for FlatRedBall so use this extension if you plan on loading in the FlatRedBall Engine.

To load a .nntx file select:

    File->Load NodeNetwork

The NodeNetwork will load and display in the AIEditor.
