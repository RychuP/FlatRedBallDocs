## Introduction

SortAxis controls how the MapDrawableBatch performs culling. This value controls how culling is performed when the MapDrawableBatch is drawn. If SortAxis is set to SortAxis.X, then the map will cull tiles from the left and right of the camera visible bounds. Otherwise, if SortAxis is set to Y, then the map will cull tiles from above and below the camera visible bounds. This value is automatically set when the map is created according to whether the map is wider (SortAxis.X) or taller (SortAxis.Y). Setting SortAxis to SortAxis.None results in the map not being culled at all when rendered.
