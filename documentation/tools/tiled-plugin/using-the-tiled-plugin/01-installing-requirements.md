## Introduction

Before we start creating levels with Tiled, we will need to install a few requirements.

### 1. FlatRedBall

First, we need to install FlatRedBall, which can be found on the [FlatRedBall Download Page](/download/.md). You may already have this installed if you have have been working with FlatRedBall.

### 2. Tiled

Next, we need to install the Tiled program. Tiled is a free, open source, cross platform editor for creating tile-based levels. We will use Tiled to create levels which can include tiled layers, collision, and entities. Tiled can be downloaded on the [Tiled page](https://www.mapeditor.org/).

### Conclusion

That's it! Glue automatically includes everything you need to use Tiled, so you can get started right away.
