The [Tutorials section](/documentation/tutorials.md) features walkthroughs of a specific tool, technology or game creation. It's a good place to start if you are new to game development or new to the FlatRedBall game engine. The [Tools section](/documentation/tools.md) contains documentation for Glue, Gum, and many of the important plugins used in FlatRedBall. The [API section](/documentation/api.md) offers documentation of the FlatRedBall engine API. If you an experienced developer looking for more information about a namespace, class or pattern, this is a good place to start. We have tried to organize our documentation by namespace, just like the engine itself!
