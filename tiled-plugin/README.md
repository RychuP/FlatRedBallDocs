# Tiled

### Introduction

FlatRedBall provides integration with Tiled using the standard .tmx (tiled map) and .tsx (tileset) files. Tiled files can be added to your project and can be rendered with no code.

Projects built with the New Project wizard automatically include level files built in Tiled.&#x20;
