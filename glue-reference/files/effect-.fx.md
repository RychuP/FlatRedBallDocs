# Effect (.fx)

Shader Effect Files (.fx) can be added to FlatRedBall projects. At runtime this produces an Effect object which can be used to perform custom rendering.

### Effect Files in MonoGame

Effect files require the use of the MonoGame Content Pipeline. If you are using the FlatRedBall Editor, this is automatically handled for you. You can verify that this is the case by checking the UseContentPipeline property.
