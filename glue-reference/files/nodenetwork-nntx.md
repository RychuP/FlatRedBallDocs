## Introduction

A NodeNetwork is a collection of nodes (points in world space), connected by links. A node network is used to perform "pathfinding" - the movement logic for navigating a map with obstacles.

## Creating a NodeNetwork in Glue

Glue has built-in support for working with NodeNetworks. To add a NodeNetwork to your level screen:

1.  Expand your **level Screen** in Glue
2.  Right-click on the **Files** folder
3.  Select **Add File** -\> **New File**
4.  Use the dropdown to select **Node Network (.nntx)**
5.  Change the name of the file if desired
6.  Click **OK**

1.  Right-click on the node network in Glue

2.  Select **View in Explorer**

3.  Right-click on node network file (.nntx) in Windows Explorer

7.  Navigate to the location where the FRBDK was unzipped (this is also where Glue is located)

8.  Find the AIEditor.exe and select that as the default application

Note that you may need to install XNA 3.1 Redistributable to run the AIEditor. For more information, see the [AIEditor page](/documentation/tools/artificialintelligenceeditor-main-page.md).
