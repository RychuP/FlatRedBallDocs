# Introduction

The "Project Specific Files" entry allows you to create files which are specific to a project. While most FlatRedBall types can load on all platforms, your project may need certain files to only be loaded on certain platforms. Reasons for this include:

* Certain platforms may not support certain file types. For example, at the time of this writing iOS does not support loading .WMA files as [Songs](../../../../frb/docs/index.php).
* Certain platforms may use different size or quality of content for performance or download reasons. For example, your game may use a larger resolution on the PC than on Windows Phone 7.
* You may be using synced projects to create demo or kiosk projects with limited content. In this case you may exclude content from your data (such as reducing the number of characters available in a CSV).
