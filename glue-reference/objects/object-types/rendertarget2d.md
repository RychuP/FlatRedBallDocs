# RenderTarget2D

RenderTarget2D instances can be created in the FRB Editor. When created in the FRB editor, they have the following behavior:

* They will automatically match the resolution of the screen
* They will be cleaned up when the Screen is destroyed

For an example on using RenderTarget2Ds with FlatRedBall Layers, see the [Layer RenderTarget](../../../api/flatredball/graphics/layer/rendertarget.md) page.
