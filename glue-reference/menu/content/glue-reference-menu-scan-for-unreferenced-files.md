# Introduction

The "Scan for Unreferenced Files" menu option performs a scan of all files referenced by the currently loaded Visual Studio project. Any file which is not directly or indirectly referenced by a file in Glue will be identified as unreferenced. Glue does not do a source-code scan of your project as it would be difficult and in many cases impossible to do so, so files referenced only by code may still be considered unreferenced. To keep this list accurate game projects should include all relevant files in Glue, especially as this helps make content loading/unloading more predictable. Once the scan completes Glue will present a window with all unreferenced files. Once a file is selected it can be removed from all projects (main and synced) by clicking the "Remove references" button: ![UnreferencedFilesWindow.PNG](../../../.gitbook/assets/migrated\_media-UnreferencedFilesWindow.PNG)
