## Introduction

The File Associations window allows you to customize the file associations for file types commonly used in Glue. All values initially start as \<DEFAULT\> meaning that those files will be opened with whatever the default for a given file is in Windows. Setting a specific file association in Glue will result in Glue using the specified application to open a file rather than the default Windows default. Changing this value will not change behavior when double-clicking the file outside of Glue.

## Common File Associations

While many FlatRedBall tools can load multiple files, each file is associated primarily with one editor:

-   achx - AnimationEditor
-   emix - ParticleEditor
-   nntx - AIEditor
-   scnx - SpriteEditor
-   shcx - PolygonEditor
-   splx - SplineEditor
