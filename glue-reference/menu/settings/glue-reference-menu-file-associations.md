# File Associations

### Introduction

The File Associations window allows you to customize the file associations for file types commonly used in FlatRedBall. All values initially start as \<DEFAULT> meaning that those files will be opened with whatever the default for a given file is in Windows. Setting a specific file association in FRB results in the FRB Editor using the specified application to open a file rather than the default Windows default. Changing this value will not change behavior when double-clicking the file outside of FRB.
