# glue-reference-file-new-project

### Introduction

The "New Project" menu item allows you to create a new project. When creating a new project, Glue provides two categories:

1. Starter Project - a fully functional FlatRedBall game including art. Starter projects let you see how FlatRedBall works with a complete game which can be modified.
2. Empty Project - an empty project for any platform

Both empty and starter projects are covered in the [FlatRedBall Tutorials page](../../documentation/tutorials.md).

### NewProjectCreator

The "New Project" menu item brings up a new program called "NewProjectCreator". For more information see the [NewProjectCreator page](../../frb/docs/index.php).
