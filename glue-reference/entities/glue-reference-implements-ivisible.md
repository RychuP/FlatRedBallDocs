# Implements IVisible

### Introduction

The Implements IVisible property controls whether an entity implements the IVisible property. If true, the FlatRedBall Editor implements this interface in generated code. Most importantly, this provides a Visible property which can be used to toggle visibility. Entities which implement the IVisible interface also provide the Visible variable for tunneling.
