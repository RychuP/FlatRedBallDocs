### Introduction

Screens and Entities [can be exported](../../../../frb/docs/index.php) from Glue. These exported Screens/Entities can then be imported back into a project. You can get exported Screens/Entities from files that you have previously exported, from other Glue users, or from [GlueVault.com](http://www.gluevault.com).

### Importing a Screen/Entity

To import a Screen/Entity:

1. Right-click on the "Screens" or "Entities" item in Glue and select "Import Screen"/"Import Entity"![ImportEntity.png](../../../../media/migrated_media-ImportEntity.png)
2. Navigate to the location of the .scrz or .entz file you want to import and click OK
3. Your Screen/Entity should now appear in your Glue project
