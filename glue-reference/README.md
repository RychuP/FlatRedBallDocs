### Is the FlatRedBall Editor Required?

Ultimately the FlatRedBall Editor generates code in response to your actions. Therefore, the editor is not required to create games. You can use it to create new projects, but then do all of your coding in Visual Studio. Of course, since the FlatRedBall Editor is built to make game development easier, we recommend using it in your game.
