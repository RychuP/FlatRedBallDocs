# animationchain

### Introduction

AnimationChains represent a series of [AnimationFrames](../frb/docs/index.php). An AnimationFrame stores information about a texture, length of the frame, horizontal/vertical flipping, texture coordinates if using [AnimationEditor:AnimationChain:Sprite Sheets](../frb/docs/index.php), and parent-relative offsets.

In game, AnimationChains represent an animated "activity" that can be performed such as attacking, running, falling down, and standing idle. Some AnimationChains generally play once such as an attack while others are cycled until game logic specifies otherwise such as an idle animation.

For information on AnimationChains in code, see the [FlatRedBall XNA AnimationChain wiki entry](../frb/docs/index.php).
