# pixel-size

### Introduction

Pixel size (also referred to as PixelSize in FlatRedBall code) is a value that controls the relationship between the size of a Sprite and the texture that it is displaying.

Pixel size controls scale, which is the measurement of a Sprite from its center to edge. For more information about pixel size, see [the PixelSize page](../frb/docs/index.php).

### Changing pixel size

You can change the pixel size of the Sprite that is displaying animations in the AnimationEditor so that it matches the pixel size of Sprites in your game. To do this:

1. Click the "Window" menu item.
2. Click "AnimationEditor Settings"
3. Click the "Animation" category.
4. Change the Main Sprite pixel size value as desired.
