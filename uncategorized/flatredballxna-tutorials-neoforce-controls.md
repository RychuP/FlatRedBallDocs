## Introduction

[Neoforce Controls](http://www.tomshane.cz/neoforce/Home/tabid/38/Default.aspx) is a library written in C# which can be used to create powerful, flexible GUI systems in your XNA game. According to their website:

The main goal is to bring friendly user interface to your games, so you can focus on the game content itself. Flexible skinning format allows you to customize each control to suit the style of your project.

Since it uses XNA, Neoforce Controls is a great alternative to FlatRedBall's GUI namespace for games.
