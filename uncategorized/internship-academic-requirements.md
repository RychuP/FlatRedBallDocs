## Introduction

Internships with FlatRedBall can provide class credit. To receive class credit, the following conditions apply:

-   The number of credits that the internship is being performed must be disclosed at the start of the internship period. Most school semesters last 16 weeks, so the internship length will match the semester or trimester length.
-   Each credit hour translates to three to five hours of work per week (depends on the school). Therefore a regular 3-credit-hour class requires nine to fifteen hours of work per week,
-   Consistency is expected during the period of internship. Every week on the internship must reach the required hours. Hours cannot be rolled over from weeks when more hours were worked, and hours cannot be made up at later weeks. An exception to this rule is provided once every four weeks. Therefore, in a 16 week internship, 12 of the 16 weeks must meet or exceed the agreed-upon hours. Furthermore, the total number of hours worked in the internship must equal the weekly hours agreed-upon multiplied by the number of weeks in the internship. Failing to meet this requirement will result in a recommended incomplete grade.
