# Introduction

The PolygonSaveList is a savable object which stores a list of [PolygonSaves](../frb/docs/index.php). This class is used by the Engine when loading lists of [Polygons](../frb/docs/index.php).

For the most basic cases, you do not need this class to load [Polygons](../frb/docs/index.php). To load [Polygons](../frb/docs/index.php) from a .plylstx file, see [this page](../frb/docs/index.php#Loading\_Polygons\_from\_File\_.28.plylstx.29).
