## Introduction

The .glux file is the master file that contains all of the information in your Glue project. The .glux project contains all of the information necessary to create all of the generated code. There's quite a bit of information contained in the .glux file!

## .glux is XML

The .glux extension means "Glue XML". Just like other FRB file formats that have extensions ending with 'x', the .glux format is a standard XML file. This means:

-   It can be loaded by any standard XML loader
-   It can have syntax coloring and folding if you open it in an XML viewer/editor
-   It can be (usually) edited by hand to perform specific tasks or eliminate errors

For a general overview of the XML format, see [this article](/frb/docs/index.php?title=General_Programming:XML.md "General Programming:XML").
