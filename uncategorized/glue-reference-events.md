# glue-reference-events

### Introduction

Events in Glue provide the ability to define custom logic which can get executed in response to certain actions in your game. For example, events can be used to navigate from one Screen to another when the user clicks on a button. If you are familiar with C#, then you are likely familiar with the concepts of events. When events are created in Glue the generated code creates events which can be used the same was as events written in pure C# code.

### Using Events

For an example on how to use events in custom code, see [the IWindow tutorial](../frb/docs/index.php). For an example on how to use events in Glue, see [the GUI in Glue tutorial](../frb/docs/index.php).
