# graphicsdevice

### Introduction

The GraphicsDevice is the object which FlatRedBall interacts with. Since FlatRedBall does rendering automatically, most users will not need to interact with this object.

You may want to work with the GraphicsDevice in the following scenarios:

* When using [DrawableBatches](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php).
* When using [render targets](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php).
