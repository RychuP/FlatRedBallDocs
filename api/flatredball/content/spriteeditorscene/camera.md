# Introduction

The SpriteEditorScene's Camera property is a [CameraSave](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) which stores information about the [FlatRedBall.Camera](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php).

This property is by default not used when loading a .scnx file by the engine. It is primarily used to store the position of the [Camera](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) in tools like the SpriteEditor and TileEditor. However, this member can be accessed to set a [Camera's](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) properties to match what has been saved.

For information on how to use the SpriteEditorScene's Camera property, see the [CameraSave](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) page.
