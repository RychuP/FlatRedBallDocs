# Position

### Introduction

The Position field can be used to get or set the position of a Sprite. A Sprite's position represents the center of the Sprite.

If a Sprite is attached to another object (such as an Entity) then its Position is determined by the position of its parent Entity and its Relative values. Attached Sprites may also be moved by their animation. In these situations, the Position value is effectively read-only.
