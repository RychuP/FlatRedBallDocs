# Introduction

The JustCycled returns true when the Sprite has just finished its animation and has _cycled_ (returned from the last frame to the first). This can be used to perform logic when a Sprite has looped its animation. For more information, see the [IAnimationChainAnimatable.JustCycled page](../graphics/animation/flatredball-graphics-ianimationchainanimatable/justcycled.md).
