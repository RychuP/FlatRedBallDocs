# ObjectsIgnoringPausing

### Introduction

ObjectsIgnoringPausing contains a list of objects which do not implement PositionedObject which should be ignored in pausing. Objects which do implement PositionedObject should not be added to this list unless they have additional pausing behavior which is checked by external systems. In a default FlatRedBall project this is not the case.

For code examples on how to use ObjectsIgnoringPausing in combination with pausing your game using PauseThisScreen, see the [Screen.PauseThisScreen](../../screens/screen/pausethisscreen.md) page.
