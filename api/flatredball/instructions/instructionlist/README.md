# instructionlist

### Introduction

The InstructionList class is a class which provides methods that can simplify manual interaction with [Instructions](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php). Most of the time you will not need to manually interact with [Instructions](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) as the FlatRedBall Engine provides automatic management for [Instructions](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php), but more sophisticated applications which need more direct access to [Instructions](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) will benefit from the use of the InstructionList class.
