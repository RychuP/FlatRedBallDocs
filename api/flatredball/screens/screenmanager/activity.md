# Introduction

The Activity function in the ScreenManager is responsible for:

* Calling Activity on the current [Screen](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php)
* Performing async screen loading activity
* Transitioning between Screens if the current Screen's [IsActivityFinished](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) is true.
