## Introduction

The PositionedObject class has a number of mirrored properties. These are properties which completely reflect similarly-named fields or other properties. The following graph shows mirrored property relationships:

|                       |                           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Property              | Associated Field/Property |
| X                     | Position.X                |
| Y                     | Position.Y                |
| Z                     | Position.Z                |
| XVelocity             | Velocity.X                |
| YVelocity             | Velocity.Z                |
| ZVelocity             | Velocity.Z                |
| XAcceleration         | Acceleration.X            |
| YAcceleration         | Acceleration.Y            |
| ZAcceleration         | Acceleration.Z            |
| RelativeX             | RelativePosition.X        |
| RelativeY             | RelativePosition.Y        |
| RelativeZ             | RelativePosition.Z        |
| RelativeXVelocity     | RelativeVelocity.X        |
