# Introduction

The NodeLinkingTo property gets or sets the [PositionedNode](../../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) that the Link connects to. Notice that a link only has one NodeLinkingTo. This means that links are "one way". Therefore, if two [PositionedNodes](../../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) need to link to each other, then each will need a Link to the other. When [NodeNetworks](../../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) are created through the AIEditor, [PositionedNodes](../../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) which link to each other do so with two Links.
