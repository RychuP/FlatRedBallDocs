# NodeLinkingTo

The NodeLinkingTo property gets or sets the [PositionedNode](../flatredball-ai-pathfinding-positionednode.md) that the Link connects to. Notice that a link only has one NodeLinkingTo. This means that links are "one way". Therefore, if two PositionedNodes need to link to each other, then each will need a Link to the other.
