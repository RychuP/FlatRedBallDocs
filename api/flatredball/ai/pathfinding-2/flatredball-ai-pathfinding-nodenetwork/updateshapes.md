# Introduction

The UpdateShapes method will refresh the visible layout of the NodeNetwork. This method is internally called when a NodeNetwork is first made visible. If you are making any changes to a NodeNetwork, such as by calling [Shift](../../../../../../frb/docs/index.php), adding/removing [PositionedNodes](../../../../../../frb/docs/index.php), or by changing the position of a [PositionedNode](../../../../../../frb/docs/index.php), then you will need to call UpdateShapes.
