# UpdateShapes

The UpdateShapes method refreshes the visible layout of the NodeNetwork. This method is internally called when a NodeNetwork is first made visible. If you are making any changes to a NodeNetwork, such as by changing existing nodes or adding new ones, you need to call UpdateShapes if you would like those changes to be reflected in the visible node network.
