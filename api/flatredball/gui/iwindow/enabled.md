# Introduction

The Enabled property determines whether a UI element will react to input events, such as being clicked. IWindow instances which have their Enabled value set to false will be skipped over by the Cursor when performing UI checks; these instances will never be assigned to the [Cursor.WindowOver](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) property.
