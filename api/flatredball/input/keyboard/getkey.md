# Introduction

The GetKey function returns an object which can be used to query information about keys. GetKey can be used in situations where the code is written against a general key, or even a general input object, as the return value from GetKey is of type [FlatRedBall.Input.KeyReference](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php), which implements [FlatRedBall.Input.IPressableInput](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php).
