## Introduction

The Texture property is a reference to the Texture2D referenced by an AnimationFrame. This is the Texture that it will apply when the animation is being displayed. This is automatically set when loading a .achx file (such as in Glue), but it can be changed at runtime, or can be set when creating a new frame.
