# Introduction

The EmissionSettings property is an instance of a [EmissionSettings](../../../../../../frb/docs/index.php). The EmissionSettings class controls the behavior of Sprites when they are created, including size, rotation, velocity, and acceleration.

The EmissionSettings property is automatically set to a new EmissionSettings object on all Emitters, so you do not need to instantiate or assign a new EmissionSettings object.

For more information on how to use the EmissionSettings object, see the [EmissionSettings page](../../../../../../frb/docs/index.php).
