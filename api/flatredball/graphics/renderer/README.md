# Renderer

### Introduction

The Renderer class is responsible for the every-frame rendering performed by the FlatRedBall engine. By default the Renderer automatically performs drawing through the FlatRedBallServices.Draw method.

### Render Targets

For information on using FlatRedBall with render targets, see [this page](../../../../frb/docs/index.php).
