# Introduction

The RenderBreak struct is a struct used internally by the engine to identify when to switch rendering states during a vertex buffer rendering pass. Vertex buffers are used to render most FRB types including [Sprites](../../../../frb/docs/index.php), [Texts](../../../../frb/docs/index.php), and [Shapes](../../../../frb/docs/index.php). You will likely not need to interact with RenderBreak if you are writing game-level code. This class is only used in rendering code.
