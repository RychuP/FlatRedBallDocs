# getuserfolder

### Introduction

The GetUserFolder method returns a string which can be used to save and load files in the user folder. To use this, the [InitializeUserFolder](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) method must be called first. The return value for GetUserFolder depends on the platform that the call is made on; however, it can be used on any platform with most methods that access the file system through the FileManager.

### Code Example

For an example on how to use GetUserFolder, see the [InitializeUserFolder](../../../../../frb/docs/index.php) article.
