Introduction The Standardize method is used to convert file names to a standard format. By default Standardize performs the following modifications to a file name:

-   It is converted to lower case
-   Backslashes are converted to forward slashes
-   Relative files are made absolute

Standardize is useful because it allows string comparison between files.
