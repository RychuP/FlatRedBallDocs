## Introduction

The FileManager provides methods and properties commonly used when working with files on the hard disk.

## Case sensitivity

Functions which access files on the file system may fail if the operating system is case sensitive (as is the case for Android and iOS).

### iOS

The iOS operating system is case sensitive; however the simulator is not case sensitive by default - this can make testing more difficult. For information on how to make the simulator run in case sensitive mode, see this link: [http://wjlafrance.net/post/44870455348/making-the-ios-simulator-case-sensitive](http://wjlafrance.net/post/44870455348/making-the-ios-simulator-case-sensitive)
