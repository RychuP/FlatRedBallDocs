The RuntimeCsvRepresentation class is a general-purpose class which represents a CSV file. It can be easily created through the [CsvFileManager](../../../../../../frb/docs/index.php).

### Loading a RuntimeCsvRepresentation

RuntimeCsvRepresentations can be loaded as follows:

```
// Assuming fileName is a valid CSV file:
RuntimeCsvRepresentation instance = CsvFileManager.CsvDeserializeToRuntime(fileName);
```
