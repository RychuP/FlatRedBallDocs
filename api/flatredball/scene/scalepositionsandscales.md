## Introduction

ScalePositionsAndScales will scale an entire Scene's position and scale values by an argument amount.

## Code Example

The following code would make a Scene 2x as large in every direction:

    // Assuming SceneInstance is a valid Scene:
    SceneInstance.ScalePositionsAndScales(2.0f);
