# Introduction

The MakeOneWay method is a method which modifies all contained objects in the Scene so that they no longer are aware that they are part of the Scene. In other words, this breaks [two-way relationships](../../../../frb/docs/index.php#A\_short\_discussion\_about\_two-way\_relationships) between the Scene and its contained objects.
