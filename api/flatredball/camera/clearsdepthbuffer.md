# ClearsDepthBuffer

## Introduction

ClearsDepthBuffer determines whether the Camera clears the depth buffer and then writes/reads the depth buffer when performing rendering. By default this value is true, and it should be true in most cases except when a camera is used to render on top of other cameras, or for debugging purposes.
