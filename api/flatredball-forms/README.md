## Introduction

FlatRedBall.Forms is a library built on top of the core FlatRedBall library and Gum. It combinesÂ the visual flexibility of Gum with a layer of standard logic to create a set of common controls for games and other high-performance applications. FlatRedBall Forms provides all of the performance and cross-platform benefits of FlatRedBall with the familiar syntax of WPF.
