## Introduction

Entity instantiation in Glue projects is standardized. The constructor appears in Generated code. The standardization of constructors enables the following:

-   Every Entity is instantiated the same way, making Entity instantiation in custom code easy
-   Generated code can instantiate any Entity allow for factory and addition of Entities inside other Entities and Screens in Glue.

For information on how to instantiate Entities, see [the following tutorial](/documentation/tutorials/glue-tutorials/basic-coding-in-glue.md "Glue:Tutorials:Basic coding in Glue").
