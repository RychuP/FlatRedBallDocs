# State Interpolation

The StateInterpolationPlugin namespace provides a number of useful methods for interpolating (also known as tweening) values using a variety of interpolation types.

The name StateInterpolationPlugin exists for historical reasons - it was previously a plugin that needed to be explicitly installed in the FlatRedBall Editor. Modern FlatRedBall projects automatically include this library, so no plugin installation is necessary. The namespace has remained for backwards compatability.
