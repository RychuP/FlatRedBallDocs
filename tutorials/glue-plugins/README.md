### Introduction

Glue is not just a tool to help you make games. At FlatRedBall we view Glue as a development platform. This means we're working to make it more open. One way of opening Glue is through a [MEF-based](http://mef.codeplex.com/) plugin system. If you're not familiar with MEF, don't worry - the tutorials below will get you up to speed in no time! \[subpages depth="1"]
