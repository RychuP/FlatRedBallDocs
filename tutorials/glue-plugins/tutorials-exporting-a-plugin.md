## Introduction

If you have written and tested a plugin, and you're now ready to share it with others, congratulations! Glue makes this process very easy. Glue supports exporting a plugin (which may be just one file or multiple files) as a single file with the .plug extension. .plug files can be shared directly with other developers or uploaded on [GlueVault.com](http://www.gluevault.com).

## Creating a .plug file

To create a .plug file:

1.  Open Glue
2.  Select "Plugins"-\>"Create Plugin"
3.  Press the "..." button to find the folder that contains your plugin![CreatePluginWindow.PNG](/media/migrated_media-CreatePluginWindow.PNG)
4.  Select the folder inside Glue's Plugins folder that contains your plugin. If you are using Windows 7, this may be located in "c:/Program Files (x86)/FlatRedBall/FRBDK/Xna 4 Tools/Plugins"
5.  Click OK
6.  Select the location and file name for the exported plugin and click OK

You will now have a .plug file which you can share with others or upload to GlueVault.
