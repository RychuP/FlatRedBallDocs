### Uploading a Build

Once you have published your build through Visual Studio, you should have a folder similar to the following image:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (155).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example published web project</p></figcaption></figure>

Open the wwwroot and create a .zip file with the contents.

Next, log in to your itch.io account and select the option to **Upload new project.**

Fill in your project's information, but be sure to set **Kind of project** to **HTML**.

Click the Upload Files option and select your .zip file that you created earlier.
