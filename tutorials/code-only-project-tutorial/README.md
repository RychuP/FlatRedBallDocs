# Code-Only Projects (No Editor)

Although the FlatRedBall Editor can help make game development much faster, some developers prefer to work more low-level, using just the FlatRedBall engine without any generated code. The following set of tutorials will show you how to create a basic code-only project.

Code-only projects can be effective if you are:

* Looking to integrate portions of FRB into an existing game (such as using FRB's collision and physics)
* Developing primarily on a platform which does not support the FRB Editor such as Linux
* Interested in developing a game without using an editor, but woud still like to use FlatRedBall for its various features (input, physics, collision management, content loading, content management, and so on)
