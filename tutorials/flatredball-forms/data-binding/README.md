# Data Binding (BindingContext)

Data binding is the process of controlling the appearance and behavior of UI through a separate object usually called a _view model_. The data binding pattern used by FlatRedBall.Forms is referred to as _Model View ViewModel_, abbreviated as MVVM. Developers familiar with data binding in WPF, Xamarin.Forms, or Knockout JS will find data binding in FlatRedBall.Forms familiar.
