## The project type is not supported by this installation

![CantOpen 1.png](/media/migrated_media-CantOpen_1.png) If you are seeing this error then you are likely missing a prerequisite for development. Make sure you've run the FRB installer and installed everything.

## Verifying XNA4 is installed

If you are unable to run Glue or new FlatRedBall XNA projects, then you may not have XNA 4.0 installed. To verify if you do, you can try to create a new project in Visual Studio.

1.  Open Visual Studio, and select File-\>New-\>Project...
2.  The new project window should appear. Look for "Windows Game (4.0)". This should appear under the Installed Templates-\>Visual C#-\>XNA GAme Studio 4.0 category.

If you do not have this option, then you should try reinstalling XNA 4.0
