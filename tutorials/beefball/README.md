# Beefball

### Introduction

If you're looking for a jump-start on how to make games with FlatRedBall and the FlatRedBall Editor, you've come to the right place. The following tutorials walk you through how to make a game called **Beefball**. Beefball is a fast-paced physics based game similar to air-hockey. What are you waiting for, let's get started!

### Code Only Projects

This tutorial covers how to create Beefball with the FlatRedBall Editor, which is the typical way to work with FlatRedBall. Of course, you can also use FlatRedBall without the editor. If you are interested in developing in a _code only_ environment, you can download the BeefballCodeOnly project which is located in the FlatRedBall Samples folder:

You can still look through this documentation to see how the project might be structured conceptually as you browse the sample code.
