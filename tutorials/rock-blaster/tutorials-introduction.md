# Introduction

### Introduction

Welcome to the Rock Blaster tutorials. Rock Blaster is a simple top-down game similar to the old Asteroids game. This set of tutorials will cover a variety of Glue topics. If you've been through the [Beefball tutorials](../beefball/), this set of tutorials will build on that information and show more Glue functionality. If you haven't yet, we recommend going through the [Beefball tutorials](../beefball/) first - they cover a lot of the basics that we will use in this game.

### What will this tutorial cover?

The Rock Blaster tutorials will reinforce some of the topics covered in the Beefball tutorials including:

* Entity creation
* Screen creation
* Object creation
* Variable creation
* File creation and management
* Collision
* Scoring
* Hud
* Game Flow

The Rock Blaster tutorials will include the following topics as well:

* Handling game graphics (PNGs)
* Rotation
* Dynamic Entity creation
* Game data (score)
* And much more!

So let's get started!
